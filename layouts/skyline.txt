Skyline Walkway

Journey along Wellington’s highest peaks from Makara Saddle to the summit of Mount Kaukau, ending in Johnsonville.

This dual use track runs North and South along the ridge between Old Coach Road in Johnsonville and Makara Saddle in Karori.

Allow up to 6 hours to traverse 13.4kms of Wellington’s ridge tops following the Outer Green Belt onto Mount Kaukau, the Crow’s Nest, Kilmister Tops and Johnston Hill. Take time to indulge in the stunning rural, city and coastal views along the way. On a clear day, views of the Kaikoura ranges, the Marlborough Sounds, Wellington city and harbour, and the Tararua and Orongorongo ranges will take your breath away.

Bring your stamina and your camera to experience one of Wellington's premier trails. The Skyline Walkway makes the perfect adventure either on bike or on foot.

You'll travel along Wellington's ridge tops above the Outer Green Belt, all the way from Makara Peak to Mount Kaukau and along Old Coach Road via the Kilmister Tops and Johnston Hill.

The terrain can be challenging and exposed in places, with plenty of steep undulations, but you'll be rewarded with skyward views across the entire Wellington region. You can complete the journey in both directions, just be prepared to set aside at least a half day.
