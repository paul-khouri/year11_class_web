<h4>Admiralty Islands</h4>

dubbed the Admiralty Islands. Large pinnacles, coral reefs, larger schools of fish and
diving depths of 15-40 metres characterise the islands.Eager divers flock to this area,
and for good reason. Around 25 dive sites scattered around the atolls harbour some of
Australia’s best diving spots. Noddy Island, Rupert’s Reef, Sugarloaf Island, Tenth of June Bombora,
Tenth of June Deep, Flat Rock and North Rock are just a selection of spots which offer incredible
diving rich in diverse marine life.</p>
<h4>Blinky’s Beach</h4>
<p>Keen surfers and body boarders head to Blinky Beach to experience what the locals have dubbed ‘Champagne Surf’.
Located on the island’s east side, the beach is the most popular place to catch a ride on some of Australia’s
least crowded waves. The unspoilt, white beach is a top spot to enjoy a relaxing picnic,
take a refreshing swim in pristine turquoise waters, or to cast a line.</p>
