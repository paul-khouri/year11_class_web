      It should have been elementary, but after some sleuthing all the
      evidence pointed to one thing: Sherlock has been crowned the nation’s
      favourite television theme tune.
      The results were announced on Saturday at a special event hosted by
      Radio Times film editor and Classic FM presenter Andrew Collins and
      award-winning composer and broadcaster Howard Goodall, following a poll
      conducted by Radio Times magazine, the BFI and Classic FM.
      Michael Price, one of the composers of the Sherlock theme tune,
      said: “Being a part of a TV show like Sherlock, which has reached so
      many people, is a genuinely humbling experience. Thanks hugely to
      all the Radio Times readers who voted for it – I can only apologise
      to everyone else who wanted their favourite to win. I voted for Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em.”
      Britain’s favourite TV theme tunes to be revealed
      Collins said: “I’m not surprised that Sherlock’s dedicated followers turned out
      en masse to support their favourite show, and it really is a stirring piece of work,
      folding Victoriana into a more modern rock-style tune.”
